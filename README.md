# Challenge 1 Accepted

## Introduction:
This project was created to simulate a junior developers most likely duties in a real world scenario using basic HTML and CSS coding. 
##
The project objective is to utilize semantic tags in the source code in order to create an accessible webpage. Also, to improve readability of the code with comments for any future changes. 

---
## Improvements:
The source code now shows a clear separation of sections with semantic tags to identify specific areas like the Header and nested Nav designations. I utilized a Figure tag with nested figcaption while the rest of the images include an Alt Text for description. Further down in the body is the Article tag followed by sub-sections. The side section was given an Aside tag with its sections. These changes should help to improve web page ranking during searches.
##
Multiple comments were included to identify changes to the source code throughout. This will help insure that future updates can continue to be easily identifiable.
## 
Overall the project was fun and allowed me to identify the many moving pieces of the web page while seeing just how much of the appearance can be affected with CSS styling. I look forward to the next project.
